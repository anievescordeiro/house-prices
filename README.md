## House Prices: How to teach and interest a beginner

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, the goal of this Kaggle competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

This structured Python notebook will take you in a simple way along a path that has many bifurcations, since data analysis is a subject that has much to explore. Here you will find a simple way to apply a Machine Learning model to predict the sale price.

In order to do this Kaggle provide 3 files:

- *data_description.txt* in which we can find detailed info about the variables.
- *train.csv* containing the data to train the ML model.
- *test.csv* containing the data  to test de ML model.
